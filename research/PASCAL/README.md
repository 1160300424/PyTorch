## The PASCAL VOC project:
- Provides standardised image data sets for object class recognition
- Provides a common set of tools for accessing the data sets and annotations
- Enables evaluation and comparison of different methods 
- Ran challenges evaluating performance on object class recognition (from 2005-2012, now finished)

## Pascal VOC data sets:
Data sets from the VOC challenges are available through the challenge links below, and evalution of new methods on these data sets can be achieved through the  [PASCAL VOC Evaluation Server](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk:8080/).  The evaluation server will remain active even though the challenges have now finished.
